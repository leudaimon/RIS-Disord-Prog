## The beginnings of a new space program

The Disordered Progression Space Program (DPSP) administrators decided to set themselves wildly ambitious objectives.
Critics said it was just a lot of gibberish to attract investment, as the Program was set initially with very modest funds and a rented North American Air Force base for the installations and facilities.

The manager though, aware of the current hype over flight and space, organized a week of inauguration events for the NASC - the Northern Alcantara Space Center. 
This started in February 15 1951, less than two months after the creation of the DPSP. A [ceremonial flight](../missions/1951-02-15-first-launch.md) was made around this very abandoned region, 
to both attract public attention and gather valuable meteorologic data on the surroundings, to find out where to safely install tracking stations, bigger launch pads and also to show the government the 
importance of investments in R&D and hiring of more personnel.

Only three days later, building on the press attention, the [first rocket](../missions/1951-02-18-to-space.md), called WAC-Corporal was launched from NASC. 
It was also one of the first rockets ever launched into space by any Space Program in the World, and successfully showed that the DPSP was in this game to compete.

These two highly successful launches warranted increased funding for the DPSP, especially when it committed to recover their next rocket using parachutes, 
and also to design a rocket-powered plane able to break the sound barrier, and start studies on the development of the technologies and practice for designing an orbital rocket. 

All the funds obtained from these promises were invested in purchasing and modernizing equipment for the manufacture of rockets. From even before the first two missions being completed, the rocket plane 
was already starting construction, as well as the upgraded WAC-Corporal. With the influx of money into rocket building and the experience gathered, this rocket was going to be built much faster. 
In parallel, a team of scientists that was already hired started researching basic aerodynamics to figure out how to design a "capsule" able to survive in the vacuum of space for a few minutes, and then reenter the atmosphere.

Translating: I bought tooling for 1.3 diameter tanks and structures for the rocket plane, 
already planning to use it for the 10X series rockets (both Bumpers and crewed), as well as the 0.3 tooling for the aerobee. 
Also, all the money thus far has been invested in upgrade points for the VAB.

In early March 1951, the recoverable version of the WAC-Corporal was [successfully launched](../missions/recovery.md), and the data obtained from this was very valuable. 
By showing that things could survive after returning from space, the DPSP committed to send a crewed craft into space, in a stunt that was considered by many to be too dangerous.
The fact both the rocket necessary for that and even the basic technology to be used to design the capsule were yet developed did not help in making people believe this was possible.
Still, a prototype of the rocket that was going to be used for this crewed flight was to be launched shortly in a test for the development of a procedure essential for orbital flights:staging.

The rocket that was being developed to show the government and investors that an orbital vehicle is possible was in active development as soon as the work in the recoverable WAC-Corporal was finished.
Sporting a much bigger engine booster, fed by a turbopump, and a second stage with two WAC-Corporal engines, this rockets was both the first two-staged rocket and the first air-lit rocket to ever be launched.
It was sent in a precisely defined angle so that it would arch during the burn of the first stage, and by engine burnout it coasted for a few seconds until out of the denser atmosphere. 
Then, a spin motor was fired and the two WAC-Corporal engines ignited, while keeping a pitch close to 35Â°. 

This made this rocket achieve then unmatched altitude (above 600km), velocity and distance, showing that the development of an orbital rocket is possible. In a controversial move the DPSP administration 
promised to launch a satellite in less than two years.

```
Translating: I picked crewed suborbital right after suborbital return, which was a mistake and I couldn't take Science Satellite. 
Once I completed the Downrange milestone I picked First Orbit, and invested in the VAB up to 0.25 BP/s, and then started getting R&D points
```

Less than a month later, the first rocket plane developed by the BPSP was ready.
