## The route for satellites

After making some very aggressive promises - a scientific satellite looking at the radiation environment around Earth before May 1953 - the DPSP administration decided to capitalize on the 
very successful launch of their first astronaut. The PR brought a lot of additional funding for the program, and the astronauts became huge celebrities. Thus, it was decided that the infrastructure for
these launches was going to be kept running, while the research and constructions for the orbital vehicles was developed. 

With the promise for a much more capable satellite than was originally suggested just a few weeks before, the first designs for a simpler orbital vehicle were scrapped, and it was decided that
a more capable LV, with more advanced engines would be pursued. The idea was to design this large rocket, that at first would be able to send basic satellites into low earth orbit, but still with 
enough capability to send the first probes under development into a polar or even sun-synchronous orbit, or into an elliptical orbit above 2000 km apogee and lower inclination.

Subsequent upgrades, both in miniaturization of the electronic components allowing for lighter payloads and in materials technology for lighter tanks, should allow the same general design and 
engines to send probes all the way to impact the moon. These later developments are still being researched and designed, but this general approach was chosen because it allowed for a tested and reliable 
LV once the DPSP had the technology to try moon shots.

With this general strategy in place, the R&D teams started researching new generations of engines, along with avionics and tracking systems for the rockets. In parallel, a new pad for this rocket and a tracking station started construction. 
In the meantime, the crewed suborbital flights were expanded to include other experiments along with them - both some biological samples to 
test the effect of free fall on other kinds of organisms and photographic equipment to start perfecting the techniques for photography from space, seen as one of the most relevant potential uses of
satellites in the future. 

Additionally, similar photographic equipment was adapted into the [Bonny](../lvs/bonny.md) airplane. It was tested there prior to launch into a suborbital trajectory. The astronauts were trained in 
the use of the equipment, and some general aerial images of the area around the NASC were obtained. 

All of these flights went flawlessly, except for two partial failures in test launches of engines in the Orbital Vehicle development program. These rockets still completed their missions of getting into
record altitude or exploring the space in different areas around the NASC. 

By the end of 1951, rumors about delays in the orbital vehicle development started to spread and the DPSP intelligence discovered that another Space Program had already managed to 
launch a satellite in a very primitive rocket. By this point, the basic technology and equipment was already developed for a first satellite to be launched, and the administration urged for it to be
launched as soon as possible. Thus, construction of the rocket started in November 1951. 

Everything went according to plan, and this 60t behemoth made it to the launch pad in April 09 1952 - still much earlier than promised by the DPSP director exactly a year earlier, but already only the third
orbital rocket to be launched in the world. Still, [the launch was flawless](../missions/first-orbit.md). Reaching a polar orbit, it was able to obtain data from all around the globe - and the possibilities for future satellites to monitor the 
climate, provide communications and navigation data globally were not ignored.

This satellite was soon followed by a [second one](../missions/sso-orbit.md), this time equipped with solar cells, widely considered the ideal way to keep satellites functioning for long periods of time. It was launched into a very
specific sun-synchronous orbit. This is a slightly retrograde orbit that uses the shape of the Earth's gravity field to stay always with the same position relative to the sun. When the technology to 
acquire images of the Earth is available, this will be the preferred orbit for Earth imaging satellites.
